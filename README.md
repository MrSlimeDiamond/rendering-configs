# Rendering-Configs

Easy to use rendering configs for Portal 2 demos.

## Introduction

Here are some feature highlights:

-   **Customisation**: Includes a config file which allows you to dynamically edit values from within the game.
-   **Props**: Makes any props in your demos look silky smooth
-   **Motion Blur**: Has the ability to frameblend your 34.2 Portal Gun demo so that it almost looks good.

## How to

Simply download the latest release and extract the zip.
From here you have two options:

-   **Main Configs**
-   **My Personal Preset**

### Main Configs

Place the contents of the render_custom folder into your Portal 2 cfg folder; usually located at `..\Steam\steamapps\common\Portal 2\portal2\cfg`.
Exec the configs in game by typing `exec render_main`, and from there, simply follow the on screen instructions.
